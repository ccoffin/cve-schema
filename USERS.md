## Accessing Older Schema Versions

Starting with 5.1.0, tagged versions are used to provide access to a given CVE record format revision. To access a specific revision, please use the following:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VEProject/cve-schema/<revision>/schema/cve-record-schema.json

For example:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VEProject/cve-schema/5.1.0/schema/cve-record-schema.json

For older CVE record format revisions, please retrieve them from the branch:

https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/tree/v5.0.0/schema

In the above, each major schema version is located in a seperate folder.
